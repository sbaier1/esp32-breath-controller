# MIDI breath controller

Trying to build a cheap midi breath controller using an ESP32 C3 board and a MPX10DP differential pressure sensor in my case. (I'm sure there are better sensors for this use case)

Ideally, it should be a MIDI BLE device that takes SYSEX for calibration + outputs the breath pressure.
